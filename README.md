Find and create a file with a grouped count for each unique combination.

#### Example Application API:
`parser.php --file:file_1.csv --unique-combinations:result_file.csv`

When the above is run the parser displays row by row each product object representation of the row. And create a file with a grouped count for each unique combination i.e. make, model, colour, capacity, network, grade, condition.
